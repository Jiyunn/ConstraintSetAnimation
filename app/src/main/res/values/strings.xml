    <string name = "msg_detail">I took this picture in my old house two years ago.\n
        My house was in a beautiful place. There were several colorful maple trees in the fall, shading in the summer.\n
        My dog liked the flower. She sniffed, sneezed, and smiled at me. (In fact, dogs can laugh.)\n
        Now, it doesn\'t exist anymore. But the beautiful moment I saw will remain in my mind forever.
